// thoughts behind dialog form system
type in information in different text boxes

when you click the confirm button,
    you gather up all of the info from all of the text
    boxes, (maybe store them in a variable), and send
    the correct info to the correct places in the
    "Book" function,

    then add that certain book to the addBookToLibrary
    function

    and then call the display function

// readButton thoughts 3/14/24 (trying to figure out
how to display each piece of info, on it's own line)

readButton = document.createElement('button');
readButton.classList.add("readButton");

function readBook() {

    books = myLibrary[JSON.stringify(i)];
    console.log(books.read)
    if (books.read)
}

title = document.createElement('p')
author = document.createElement('p')
pages = document.createElement('p')
readStatus = document.createElement('p')

title.textContent = (`Title: ${book.title}')
author.textContent = (`Author: ${book.author}')
pages.textContent = (`Pages: ${book.pages}')
readStatus.textContent = (`Read Status: ${book.read}')

bookCard.appendChild(title);
bookCard.appendChild(author);
bookCard.appendChild(pages);
bookCard.appendChild(readStatus);


when you click the read button 
    it would alter the text content of the books.read
    to either
        Read
    or to
        not read yet


when you submit a book form
    if (book.read == "read" || book.read == "Read") {
        readButton.textContent = "Read"
    }
    if (book.read == "not read yet" ||
    book.read == "Not read yet") {
        readButton.textContent = "Not read yet"
    }

// error with readButton.textContent 3/15/24

when you make two different cards with the read buttons
when you click the read button on one of them, the other
one updated instead of the one being clicked
    I think this has to do with the readButton.
    textContent, because it's not selecting 
    the right card based on the the bookID.
