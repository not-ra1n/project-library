// thoughts behind dialog form system
type in information in different text boxes

when you click the confirm button,
    you gather up all of the info from all of the text
    boxes, (maybe store them in a variable), and send
    the correct info to the correct places in the
    "Book" function,

    then add that certain book to the addBookToLibrary
    function

    and then call the display function
